This repository contains the full contents of my day-to-day emacs configuration. Inspired by vim, spacemacs, EOS (writequit.org/eos), DOOM (hlissner/doom) and cyberpunk (overtone/emacs-live). It attempts to provide an ergonomic and modern development and writing environment with consistent behavior. Targeting *Arch Linux* on kernel 4.10+, emacs version *25+*. It is always a work in progress and currently undergoing major improvements and refactoring.

* DONE Languages
The primary languages I work on using emacs are:
- Python for shell scripting
- Golang for the quick and easy, slowly supplanting python
- Clojure for long running programs and CLJS
- C++ for my (sort of) day job
- LaTeX for all of my homework and report writing
- Orgmode for task management and remembering things
