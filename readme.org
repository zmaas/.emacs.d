* My .emacs.d!
This repository contains the full contents of my current and active use .emacs.d. This is what I use on a day-to-day basis. It has evolved lots over time, and lots of the inspiration for my setup comes from spacemacs. This works very well for me.
* To Do
1. [ ] Add dark theme and create theme files
2. [ ] Add orgmode keybindings to general leader
3. [ ] Improve the readme.md. Convert to init.org
4. [ ] Add screenshots for my theming.
