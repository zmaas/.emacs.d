* About

This repository contains the full contents of my day-to-day Emacs configuration. Inspired by vim, spacemacs, EOS (writequit.org/eos), DOOM (hlissner/doom) and cyberpunk (overtone/emacs-live). It attempts to provide an ergonomic and modern development and writing environment with consistent behavior. Targeting *Arch Linux* on kernel 4.10+, Emacs version *25+*. It is always a work in progress and currently undergoing major improvements and refactoring.

* Why Emacs?

If you stumbled onto this repository from one of my personal pages and you're not familiar with Emacs, you might be wondering why someone would put so much work into a single application. At its core, Emacs is an application for editing text efficiently. But, Emacs is more than just a text editor - It is a fully featured and extensible lisp machine. Essentially, it is an application that you can rewrite on the fly to do whatever you want. Writing, programming? Absolutely. Email, news, web-browsing, and more? Of course! And since Emacs has been around since the 1980's, it is here to stay.

* Goals

As wonderful as stock Emacs is, it can lack some of the amenities of modern applications. The big things I try to implement with this configuration are:
- Better integration of evil-mode. VIM's modal editing paradigm is something I started on when I was very young, and anything else just feels wrong. To do this, I include a large number of extended plugins that extend or fix functionality to be more in-line with my expectations.
- Ergonomic keybindings that are largely mnemonic. VIM sets an excellent precedent here. I use a leader key (SPC) with bindings mapped to the homerow and repeated positions as much as possible.
- Fast development. By using the many packages with first-class REPL support along with other tools like quickrun, the rate of prototyping and production can be significantly accelerated.
- Smarter defaults. From hot-plugging better alternatives to things like just-one-space and zap-to-char, to extended tools like swiper and imenu-anywhere, plus management packages like use-package and shackle, there are a ton of places where a little bit of work to clean up the defaults makes Emacs that much more of a joy to use.
- An internal module system that avoids circular dependency trees and ensures that modules are loaded in the proper order every single time. This is still very much a work in progress, but is getting there. I hope that by doing this I can keep this configuration from ever getting out of hand.

* Languages
The primary languages I work on using Emacs are:
- Python for shell scripting
- Golang for the quick and easy, slowly supplanting python
- Clojure for long running programs and CLJS
- C++ for my (sort of) day job
- LaTeX for all of my homework and report writing
- Orgmode for task management and remembering things
Other languages that have some level of support are:
- Common lisp, because lisp is beautiful
- Racket and other schemes, same as above
- Haskell, because I really enjoy functional programming
- R, for statistical programming
- Various markdown languages
- More to come!
